    "### What is machine learning?\n",
    "Machine learning is a technique of data science where computers can learn from data without being explicitly programmed to predict future behavior, trends, pattern and outcomes. Some examples are detecting spam emails, classifying images into multiple groups, forecast weather of tomorrow or next week. For example, if machine sees a similarity of characteristics between a current transaction with previously recorded as fraud transaction, it can generate an alert and block the transaction flagged it as potential for fraud. It also probabilistic rather deterministic. For example, saying that the transaction is either appropriate of fraud with complete certainty it will say that there is 85.5% chance that transaction is fraud."

    "### Azure Machine Learning – A closer look:\n",
    "Azure Machine Learning provides suite of tools and technology that enables developer to build, train, evaluate, deploy and manage machine learning model art scale. It supports most popular developer’s tools that are easy to use, flexible and integrated. For example, as an IDE for developers it offers Jupyter Notebook (OSS) and Visual Studio tools for AI. This makes it easy to explore and visualize data, clean and transform, engineer features, build and test models and deploy in a scalable infrastructure. It lets you experiment to your local machine and then deploy when you are ready to a large-scale compute infrastructure of your choice. \n",
    "It also comes with full scale Azure Machine Learning SDK for python, one of the most popular language in machine learning today. It comes with most popular python packages which you will need to build machine learning models. There are many open source packages available such as \n",

    "    > Scikit-learn\n",

    "    > PyTorch\n",

    "    > MXNet\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get a native support of Azure Batch AI compute infrastructure along with advanced hyperparameter tuning services. You can deploy them using container image such as docker. It means you can either use azure container services (ACS) or Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)."

    "### How it is different from Azure ML studio?\n",
    "Azure ML studio is a no code approach to build, train and deploy model. You can get quickly started with azure ML studio if you are starting fresh and need to build and deploy model quickly and that doesn’t need lot of skills of machine learning. This is a drag and drop approach and you can get most of the popular models such as classification and regression type problems. You can also quickly deploy the model using web service which will use REST API for you. But if you want most flexible environment where you want to control development and deployment options you need to use azure machine learning for richer model development experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure machine learning model also comes with feature called automated machine learning where model is built for you that you can train with your data, test and deploy as any other model. These are sets of model collections that are very rich, powerful and highly optimized. Automated machine learning also comes with suite of features for data processing that are very common in machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use these tools through interactive IDE such as Jupyter notebook, Visual Studio Tool for AI or use data prep SDK in python as part of boarder Azure Machine Learning SDK package. Currently data prep SDK supports impute missing value, fuzzy group auto join, automated file type detection, varying schema processing and others. These tools can be used as cross platform manner in windows, Mac, Linux and Spark as scale out manner for high performance."
